Mark Note - Privacy Policy
Mark Note pays great attention to the privacy of users, and it will never collect any of your private content.

In addition, Mark Note will never modify or read your clipboard content without permission or notice.

Mark Note has applied for storage permissions only for file export and automatic backup. In addition, it will not read or modify any files in your external storage without permission or notice, and you can completely refuse to grant storage permissions, but doing so will result in loss of automatic backup functionality.

In particular, Mark Note will never upload any of your articles, but because the title of the article as a file name may generate errors, Mark Note will obtain your articles when the article title causes a crash error.
